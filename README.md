This repository contains the code used in the talk _Leveraging Docker to Build Serverless Platforms_ by [Tercio de Melo](https://github.com/terciodemelo) to take place on October 1st [Docker Meetup at VTEX Rio de Janeiro](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Rio-de-Janeiro/events/264791000/).

It doesn't aim to provide a production ready infrastructure, but rather experiment with Docker inner APIs to gain insight into container orchestration systems by implementing a serverless Python system.

# Repository Organization
Each stage of our experiment is be properly documented in this very `README.md` file, and each stage is accessible by a Git branch in the format `stage-{int}`. Each component of our system is contained in its own directory under the root directory, with a dedicated `README.md` documenting the component. Components are leveraged with Docker Compose.  

# Stage 2

The goal of this stage is to create an API that leverages the Docker Daemon API to list running containers and run an arbitrary Python code.
